Login is an Android application that uses public key cryptography for user authentication. It accepts challenges sent via NFC and returns, if possible, the correct response. Android Beam's peer-to-peer mode is used for communication and ECDSA with SHA-256 for cryptography for communication.

This project is a proof of concept system of a authentication scheme I developed for my Bachelor's thesis. For further infomation don't hesitate to contact me.
